# NOT INTENDED FOR DIRECT USE

If you'd like to use my fork, try [github.com/marcus-crane/go-psn-api](github.com/marcus-crane/go-psn-api).

Golang is being shitty and not surfacing my fork as a usable package (it tries to resolve the source repo) so I'm using this to get around it.

Eventually I intend to upstream my changes anyway.
